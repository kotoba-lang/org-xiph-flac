  "Conformance against the reference implementation (`flac`), sample for sample.

   FLAC is lossless, so there is exactly one right answer and a decoder either
   produces it or does not. The portable suite proves that for five recorded
   files; this adds the breadth a recording cannot carry — every compression
   level, three bit depths, mono and stereo, and sources chosen so that each
   subframe type and each stereo decorrelation mode actually occurs.

   Skipped loudly when `flac` or `ffmpeg` is missing."
