  "FLAC encoding: fixed predictors and Rice-coded residuals.

   The pipeline is decide-by-counting throughout, which is why this is tractable
   where an LPC encoder is not. For each block and channel: try CONSTANT, then
   the five fixed predictors, then VERBATIM, cost each in bits, and keep the
   cheapest. For each residual: try every partition order, and within each
   partition every Rice parameter, and keep the cheapest. No search heuristics,
   no tuning constants.

   **LPC is included**: autocorrelation, the Levinson-Durbin recursion, and
   coefficient quantisation with error feedback, tried at every order up to 12 and
   kept only when it costs fewer bits than the best fixed predictor. The residual
   is computed with the *quantised* coefficients through the same floor division
   the decoder uses — an encoder that predicts in floating point and lets the
   decoder predict in integers produces a file only it can read.

   **Stereo decorrelation** is chosen the same way: a two-channel block is costed
   as independent, left/side, right/side and mid/side, and the cheapest wins. On
   material where the channels are similar this matters more than LPC does — a
   duplicated channel makes the side channel all zeros."
